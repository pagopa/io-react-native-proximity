### React Native

Follow the [official tutorial](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup?guide=native) for installing the `React Native CLI` for your operating system.

If you have a macOS system, you can follow both the tutorial for iOS and for Android. If you have a Linux or Windows system, you only need to install the development environment for Android.

### Build the app

In order to build the app,
As stated [previously](#nodejs-and-ruby), we also use `nodenv` and `rbenv` for managing the environment:

```bash
# Clone the repository
$ git clone https://github.com/pagopa/io-react-native-proximity

# CD into the repository
$ cd io-react-native-proximity

# Install library dependencies
$ yarn install

# CD into the example folder
$ cd example

# Install bundle
$ gem install bundle

# Install the required Gems from the Gemfile
# Run this only during the first setup and when Gems dependencies change
$ bundle install

# Install example dependencies
# Run this only during the first setup and when JS dependencies change
$ yarn install

# Install podfiles when targeting iOS (ignore this step for Android)
# Run this only during the first setup and when Pods dependencies change
$ cd ios && bundle exec pod install && cd ..

# Run the app on iOS
$ yarn ios

# Run the app on Android
$ yarn android
```
